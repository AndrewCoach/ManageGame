# Game of Resource Management
*Currently being developed*
This game prototype simulates a game of managing resources for a character, choosing different items to use, eat or drink will have different effects on the character's health!

## The Interface and usage

</p>

This is the simplified interface panel. At the top the main character image is displayed (currently corn).
On the bottom left sits a panel with different tabs, each tab containing a certain amount of usable items.
On the right is the character state displayee with bars.

Upon clicking on a certain item, the stats of the character can change in different ways.

</p>

Different items will result in different actions, also it is not wise to use the same item repeatedly in rapid succession.

The panel can be resized in any way desired.


## Planned updates
- Adding more objects.
- Obtaining PNG assets for the avatar.
- Implementing all effects for the different items.
- Implementing other areas of the game, such as death, sports activities etc.
- Implement behavior for repeatedly using the same item.
